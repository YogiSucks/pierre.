# pierre.
a flash game i made in like 2 hours.
you shouldn't really expect much from this game, it's just a generic platformer with impossible parts that i made just for the heck of it.

if you want to play pierre, you need some way to get the Adobe Flash Player, this can be done by using Flashpoint to pin the Flash Player to your Taskbar (on windows, at least.), or by finding an old installer and running it. once you are on the player, click FIle, then Open. click Browse once the prompt to enter a url appears, then select the pierre.swf file and click ok, after that, it's time to play pierre.
